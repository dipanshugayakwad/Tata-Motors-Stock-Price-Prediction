# Tata-Motors-Stock-Price-Prediction

Welcome to the Tata Motors Stock Prediction project! This repository focuses on predicting Tata Motors' stock prices using machine learning. Let's dive into the essentials:

üìà **Predictive Aim**: We're all about predicting future stock prices of Tata Motors, helping investors make informed decisions.

üìä **Data**: Historical daily stock prices of Tata Motors, with features like Open, High, Low, Close prices, and trading volume.

üõ†Ô∏è **Approach**: We use Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Machine Learning Models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM neural networks.

üìÅ **Structure**:
- `data/`: Holds historical stock price data (not in the repo).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and modeling.
- `src/`: Source code for preprocessing and models.
- `requirements.txt`: Required packages.
- `README.md`: You're reading it!
- `.gitignore`: Git ignore file.

## Get Started

1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tata-motors-stock-prediction.git`
2. Navigate: `cd tata-motors-stock-prediction`
3. Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Data: Obtain and save historical data as `data/tata_motors.csv`.

## Usage

1. Place the downloaded dataset in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the main prediction script: `python predict.py`
3. The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train different models, and display the predictions.

## Methods

We employ the following methods and techniques in this project:

- Data preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
- Feature selection: Identifying relevant features for prediction.
- Model selection: Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM).
- Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing model parameters for better performance.
- Evaluation: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error).

## Results

The results obtained from the models are promising, with some models outperforming others based on evaluation metrics. We provide detailed insights and analysis of the prediction accuracy in the [Results](/results) directory.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! Feel free to open issues for discussions or submit pull requests for improvements. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss the proposed changes.
